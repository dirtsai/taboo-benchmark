You are analyzing a failed hint in a Taboo word guessing game. In this game, one player tries to get another to guess a target word without using certain taboo words.

TARGET WORD: nominal
TABOO WORDS: object|phrase|nominal|subject|token
FAILED HINT: """"
SENSE COUNT: 7 (number of different meanings/senses this word has)

Please analyze why this hint failed to help the guesser identify the target word. Categorize the failure using one or more of these labels:
- TOO_VAGUE: The hint was too general or abstract
- AMBIGUOUS_SENSE: The hint could apply to multiple meanings of the word
- TABOO_LIMITED: The taboo words severely restricted effective hint options
- NEAR_CORRECT: The hint was almost effective but missing a key aspect
- IRRELEVANT_HINT: The hint focused on aspects unrelated to the core meaning
- REPHRASING_DIFFICULTY: The hint struggled to rephrase the concept without taboo words

","LABELS: [TOO_VAGUE, TABOO_LIMITED]EXPLANATION: The hint failed because it was completely absent, providing no information for the guesser to work with. This lack of a hint can be attributed to the difficulty in crafting a clue for ""nominal"" without using the taboo words, which are closely related to its primary meanings. The word ""nominal"" has multiple senses, including its use in linguistics, economics, and general language, making it challenging to convey without directly referencing the restricted terms. The absence of a hint suggests that the player found it too difficult to rephrase the concept effectively without the taboo words, leading to a complete lack of guidance for the guesser.OVERALL: The main failure reason was the complete absence of a hint, likely due to the difficulty in rephrasing the concept without using the taboo words.","['[TOO_VAGUE', 'TABOO_LIMITED]EXPLANATION: The hint failed because it was completely absent', 'providing no information for the guesser to work with.
