You are analyzing a failed hint in a Taboo word guessing game. In this game, one player tries to get another to guess a target word without using certain taboo words.

TARGET WORD: nominal
TABOO WORDS: object|phrase|nominal|subject|token
FAILED HINT: """"
SENSE COUNT: 7 (number of different meanings/senses this word has)

Please analyze why this hint failed to help the guesser identify the target word. Categorize the failure using one or more of these labels:
- TOO_VAGUE: The hint was too general or abstract
- AMBIGUOUS_SENSE: The hint could apply to multiple meanings of the word
- TABOO_LIMITED: The taboo words severely restricted effective hint options
- NEAR_CORRECT: The hint was almost effective but missing a key aspect
- IRRELEVANT_HINT: The hint focused on aspects unrelated to the core meaning
- REPHRASING_DIFFICULTY: The hint struggled to rephrase the concept without taboo words

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE EXACTLY AS FOLLOWS:
LABELS: [comma-separated list of applicable labels]
EXPLANATION: [your detailed analysis of why the hint failed]
OVERALL: [brief summary of the main failure reason]
